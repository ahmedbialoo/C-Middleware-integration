We needed to:

Accept JSON as an array [...] from an external system (like Postman or EDAAT).
Transform it into the format that Dynamics 365 F&O service expects:
{
  "Invoices": [ { ... } ]
}
1. Authenticate with Azure AD v1.0 (OAuth2 client_credentials).
2. Call the Dynamics service SC_ReceivePaymentService.processPayments(List Invoices).
3. Return clean, business-friendly responses instead of raw Dynamics errors.
